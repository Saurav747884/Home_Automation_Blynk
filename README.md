# IoT-Based Home Automation System 
Project Overview
This project focuses on leveraging IoT technology to create an intelligent and automated home system. With this system, users can control and monitor various home appliances using their smartphones or internet-enabled devices. The automation also includes the capability to perform predefined tasks, enhancing convenience and energy efficiency. For instance, tasks like automatically managing lighting, temperature, and water levels are made seamless with this system.

The project includes three key automation features:

1. Garden Light Automation
The system intelligently controls garden lights based on the intensity of ambient light detected by an LDR (Light Dependent Resistor). Lights remain OFF during daylight hours and automatically switch ON as it gets darker.

2. Room Temperature Monitoring
Using an LM35 temperature sensor, the system continuously monitors the room's temperature. If the temperature exceeds 35Â°C while the heater is ON, the system automatically turns OFF the heater to ensure safety and prevent overheating.

3. Water Level Management
The water tank's inlet and outlet valves are controlled via serial communication. When the water level reaches full capacity, the inlet valve is turned OFF. If the water level drops below 2000 liters, the inlet valve is automatically activated to refill the tank.
